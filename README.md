# ðŸ§  CIFAR-10 Image Classifier using PyTorch

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. It includes model training, evaluation, and prediction on custom images.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

- **CIFAR-10** contains 60,000 color images (32x32) in 10 classes:

airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck


 The dataset is loaded using `torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(download=True)`.



## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… Custom CNN model using PyTorch's `torch.nn`
- âœ… Trained on CIFAR-10 with optimizer and loss tracking
- âœ… Model saved as `.pth` file for reuse
- âœ… Prediction on custom images
- âœ… Training and test accuracy tracking
